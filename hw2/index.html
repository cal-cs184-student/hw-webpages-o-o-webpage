      <h2>Overview</h2>
      In this assignment, we worked on De Casteljau algorithm for Bezier curves,
      area-weighted vertex normals for Phong shading, edge flip, edge split, and
      loop subdivision for generating smoother meshes. We encountered an
      infinite loop bug while doing part 6, solved the bug by tracing back to
      the flip function and adding validation steps.

      <h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

      <h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
      De Casteljau algorithm is a way to find points that lie on the Bezier
      Curves. Since the evaluateStep function performs only one step of the de
      Casteljau algorithm, what we do in this function is simply use linear
      interpolation to compute the (n-1) intermediate control points given the
      original n control points and t value, and return these (n-1) points. The
      linear interpolation is performed between adjacent pairs of control points
      using the formula (1-t)p₁ + tp₂, which gives us a point that is t of the
      way from p₁ to p₂. This iteration finally gives us a single final point
      given a specific t value that lies on the Bezier curve. In the end, when
      we connect all the single final points we evaluated from the t values
      ranging from 0 to 1, we get the desired Bezier curve.

      <h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
      We use the Separable 1D de Casteljau Algorithm to extend de Casteljau
      algorithm to Bezier surfaces. Unlike using the original de Casteljau
      algorithm to evaluate a Bezier curve, in which we are given a single
      parameter t and a vector of 2D points, here we are given two parameters u
      and v and a vector of vectors of 3D points. As the name “Separable 1D de
      Casteljau Algorithm” suggests, we first evaluate the final single point of
      each row using the parameter u, which we call the row point, and then
      evaluate the final single point of these row points using the parameter v.
      With this process, we get the final single point of (u,v); by evaluating
      the final single points of different combinations of (u,v), we can get the
      desired Bezier surface.

      <h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

      <h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
      To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we use the half-edge data
      structure to efficiently traverse all faces incident to a vertex. The
      implementation begins by initializing a zero vector, “accumulator,” to
      accumulate the weighted normal contributions. Next, we iterate through all
      non-boundary faces incident to the vertex using the half-edge structure.
      This traversal is performed by starting at one outgoing half-edge from the
      vertex (obtained via the halfedge() method which returns a HalfedgeCIter
      since we're implementing a const function). The traversal continues by
      moving to each adjacent face using h->twin()->next() and loops until we
      return to the starting half-edge, effectively visiting every face
      connected to our vertex. For each face encountered during traversal, we
      first check if it's a boundary face. Boundary faces are skipped as these
      virtual faces don't contribute to the normal. For non-boundary faces, we
      extract the three vertex positions that form the triangle and calculate
      two edge vectors from the current vertex to its neighbors. We then compute
      the face normal using the cross product of these edges and add this vector
      directly to the accumulator. This approach properly weights each face's
      contribution proportionally to its area because the magnitude of the cross
      product of two edges is already proportional to twice the triangle's area.
      By simply accumulating these unnormalized normals, we ensure that larger
      faces have proportionally greater influence on the final vertex normal.
      Finally, we normalize the accumulated vector to return a unit normal
      vector. This area-weighted approach creates smoother shading transitions
      when using Phong shading, as it better approximates the true surface
      normal at the vertex by considering the geometric importance of each
      adjacent face.

        <table
          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
      The edge flip operation is pretty straightforward but kind of tedious. We
      first see if either face is on the boundary by checking if either
      e0->halfedge()->face()->isBoundary() or
      e0->halfedge()->twin()->face()->isBoundary() is true; if either of them is
      true, we simply return e0 as it could not be flipped. The remaining work
      is just getting all the edges, halfedges, vertices, and faces, and
      updating their pointers using brute-force, as we could not find any tricks
      to update them directly. The order of updating is as follows: update
      halfedge vertices to a and d, update next() pointers in CCW order, update
      face pointers for halfedges, update halfedge for faces and edges, update
      halfedge for each vertices.

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
      We don’t find splitting trickier than flipping; it is just a little more
      tedious with almost the same process. We created 1 new vertex, 2 new
      faces, 4 new edges, and 6 new halfedges. Checking boundary is the same as
      part 4, and the remaining work is just getting all the edges, halfedges,
      vertices, and faces, and updating their pointers using brute-force, as we
      still could not find any tricks to update them directly.

      </div>

      <h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
      We implemented Loop subdivision by first marking existing vertices and
      edges, then calculating new positions using weighted averages. For
      existing vertices, we applied the formula (1 - n * u) * original_position
      + u * original_neighbor_position_sum, where u depends on vertex degree.
      For edge midpoints, we used 3/8(A+B) + 1/8(C+D) where A, B are endpoints
      and C, D are opposite vertices. After calculating positions, we split
      original edges, marked new vertices, flipped appropriate edges connecting
      new and old vertices, and finally updated all positions. The most
      challenging debugging issue was an infinite loop during the second
      subdivision, caused by improper maintenance of halfedge connectivity in
      the flipEdge function. By adding validation steps and ensuring vertex
      halfedge pointers always referenced valid outgoing halfedges, we resolved
      this issue. Loop subdivision progressively smooths meshes with each
      iteration. Sharp features like the teapot's spout and handle edges become
      increasingly rounded because the weighting scheme averages vertex
      positions with neighbors, diminishing the influence of original sharp
      vertices. Pre-splitting edges along sharp features helps preserve them
      better by introducing more control points before subdivision, giving the
      algorithm more vertices to work with and reducing the "averaging
      distance." When subdividing a standard cube, asymmetry develops after
      multiple iterations because the initial diagonal triangulation creates
      uneven connectivity across the cube. Since Loop subdivision weights
      vertices based on connectivity, this asymmetry amplifies with each
      subdivision step. By pre-processing the cube with strategic edge splits
      and flips to create consistent connectivity patterns, we achieved more
      symmetric subdivision results. This works because loop subdivision
      maintains symmetry when the input mesh has symmetric connectivity
      structure, demonstrating that the algorithm depends not just on geometry
      but on the underlying mesh topology.
