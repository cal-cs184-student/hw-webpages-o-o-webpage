      <h2>Overview</h2>
      Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think
      about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what
      interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

      <h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
      With the three points given, we first find the bounding box of the
      triangle. We check the coordinates of three points and then find the
      minimum or maximum values to determine the boundaries of the bounding box.
      We then iterate through each pixel inside the box, checking if its center
      is inside the triangle by the three-line test. The three-line test checks
      if L0, L1, and L2 are all positive or all negative, ensuring the point is
      on the same side of each edge, meaning it lies inside or on the boundary
      of the triangle. If it is, we rasterize the point. Our algorithm is
      exactly the one that ‚Äú checks each sample within the bounding box of the
      triangle,‚Äù so it‚Äôs definitely no worse than it.

        Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each
        <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might
        find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an
        organized fashion.

      <h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
      1. Since supersampling is not required for points and lines, to make them
      look normal under supersampling, we change fill_pixel to fill all samples
      in a pixel with the same color. 2. To make enough space for supersampling,
      we multiply the original size of the sample buffer by sample_rate. 3. We
      also need to change the sample buffer size when the window size changes;
      this is achieved in set_framebuffer_target by simply multiplying the
      original size by the sample rate. 4. In Task 1, we only tested one point
      per pixel (at pixel center). For Task 2, we modify rasterize_triangle to
      test multiple sample points within each pixel (in a sqrt(sample_rate) √ó
      sqrt(sample_rate) grid) and store each sample's color in the sample
      buffer. 5. Finally, we average the colors in resolve_to_buffer‚Äîinstead of
      just one color like in Task 1‚Äîwithin each pixel to complete our
      supersampling. As the sample rate increases, the edges of the triangle
      appear smoother. By averaging the colors of all sub-samples within each
      pixel, we achieve more gradual transitions along the edges, thereby
      reducing the jagged look.

      <h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
      Barycentric coordinates provide a method for representing the position of
      a point relative to the three vertices of a triangle. They enable linear
      interpolation of values at the vertices, making them useful for defining
      position, color, texture, and other attributes. The triangle we created in
      the picture below has red, green, and blue as its respective vertex
      colors; inside the triangle, the closer a point is to a vertex, the more
      similar its color to the vertex‚Äôs color. And in the middle of the
      triangle, where the point has an equal distance to three vertices, we can
      see its color is a blend of red, green, and blue.

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
      Here we use pixel sampling to determine the texture color of a pixel. We
      do so by finding each sample point's texture coordinates using barycentric
      interpolation after confirming the point is inside the triangle using the
      three line test. With each sample point's UV coordinates, we can find its
      position in texture space; then, we use methods like sample_nearest and
      sample_bilinear to get its color. In nearest neighbor sampling, we use the
      color of the nearest texel directly; while in bilinear sampling, we blend
      the colors of the four closest texels using linear interpolation. The
      nearest sampling tends to produce sharp and distinct colors within each
      pixel since it is determined by a single texel; this results in visible
      transitions between pixels as their colors can differ significantly. For
      bilinear sampling, since we interpolate between four texels, we get much
      smoother transitions between colors, meaning the change between adjacent
      pixels is more gradual. We may infer, then, that the difference between
      these two methods becomes most apparent in areas where the texture
      transitions between contrasting colors, or when the texture is viewed at
      an angle or magnified.

      <h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
      Level sampling is used for texture antialiasing; it is a method of
      filtering before sampling and is cheaper compared to supersampling for
      textures. The process of texture mapping is basically the same as in task
      5, except that here we also need to find the UV coordinates of (x+1, y)
      and (x, y+1), which helps us determine how quickly the texture coordinates
      are changing and tells us which mipmap level to use. To compute the level
      of our sample points we use the formula below.
      <img src="img/task6equation.png" width="800px" />
      We then need to address each combination between different pixel sample
      methods and level sampling methods. Most of them are straightforward,
      except for L_linear, where we need to compute the weighted sum of adjacent
      miplevels. L_ZERO uses the zeroth mip level, which corresponds to the
      original texture resolution. L_NEAREST selects the nearest mip level.
      L_LINEAR interpolates between two adjacent mip levels by applying
      P_NEAREST or P_LINEAR to each level and then computing a weighted sum.
      More samples per pixel (supersampling) provides the strongest antialiasing
      but has the highest computational and memory cost since we need to store
      and process multiple samples for each pixel. Pixel sampling, depending on
      a specific sampling method and sample rate, would also lead to good
      antialiasing power in the cost of inefficiency in speed and memory usage.
      P_NEAREST is faster but produces lower quality images with more aliasing,
      while P_LINEAR produces smoother images by interpolating between pixels
      but requires more computation time. Both methods use similar amounts of
      memory. Level sampling (mipmaps) offers the best balance: it efficiently
      handles texture aliasing by pre-filtering textures at different
      resolutions, requiring less memory than supersampling and less computation
      at runtime, while still maintaining good image quality. While it may not
      provide the same level of antialiasing as supersampling, it has a good
      balance for texture mapping compared to the previous two techniques.
